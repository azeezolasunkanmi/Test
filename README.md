# User Card Component

A dynamic and responsive user card component built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created as part of an online web developer test. The user card displays information such as the user's name, age, email, and additional info, with a hover effect that slightly scales and rotates the card for a more interactive feel.

## Description

This project involves a user card component that displays the user's profile information in a visually appealing way. The user cards are populated dynamically from an array of user data. Each card shows the user's name, age, email, and additional information. The component includes the following features:

- **Dynamic data rendering**: User data is loaded from a predefined array.
- **Hover effect**: When you hover over a card, it slightly scales and rotates to add interactivity.
- **Handling missing data**: If the user data (like age or info) is missing, fallback text or default values are shown.
- **Responsive layout**: The user cards adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a good experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
